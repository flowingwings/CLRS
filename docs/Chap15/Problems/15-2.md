> A **_palindrome_** is a nonempty string over some alphabet that reads the same forward and backward. Examples of palindromes are all strings of length $1$, $\text{civic}$, $\text{racecar}$, and $\text{aibohphobia}$ (fear of palindromes).

Supposing the given string is $A$, to find its longest palindrome subsequence(LPS), just simply reverse it to get a string $B$ and find the longest common subsequence(LCS) of $A$ and $B$.

This process takes time of $O(n^2)$ level, according to the DP algorithm of the LCS problem.
